<p>
  Splits an existing <code>map</code>/<code>collect</code>/<code>each</code> block by introducing a <code>map</code>/<code>collect</code> before it.

  <em>Warning: In some situations the substitution may be semantically different.</em>
  For example, when the iterator is not lazy and there are side-effects being performed by the extracted statements, the side-effects will be executed in a different order.

  It is recommended to check the code behaviour after applying this intention.
